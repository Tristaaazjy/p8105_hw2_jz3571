# Problem 1
```{r}
nyc_df = read_csv('./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv') %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:station_longitude, starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  mutate(route8 = as.character(route8), route9 = as.character(route9), route10 = as.character(route10), route11 = as.character(route11)) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
  
```

The date has `r nrow(nyc_df)` rows and `r ncol(nyc_df)` columns and it contains variables: `r names(nyc_df)`. The above date cleaning steps include selecting required variables, converting route 8-11 into character variables and converting entry variable from chatacter variable to logic variable. These data are not tidy yet.

- Number of Distint Stations

```{r}
nyc_df %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct %>% 
  nrow()
```

There are 465  distinct stations.

- Number of Ada Compliant Stations

```{r}
nyc_df %>% 
  filter(ada == 'TRUE') %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct %>% 
  nrow()
```

There are 84 stations are ADA compliant


- Number of stations without vending alowing entrance

```{r}
nyc_df %>% 
  filter(vending == 'NO') %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean()
```

There are 37.7% of the entrances/exits without vending allow entrance.
